# Transversal CMR Segmentation
Experiments into segmentation of transversal slices of cardiac MR images

## Initial model
Trained using fastai v1 on 138 images (90 training, 48 validation) from 6 volunteers. Classes to predict were left ventricular cavity and left ventricular myocardium.

The provided model file (see release page) `b0_transversal_5_5.pth` is the base model from
